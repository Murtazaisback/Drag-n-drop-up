#DndExample Project
This project demonstrates a drag-and-drop interface for managing components within a board. The app uses react-beautiful-dnd for the drag-and-drop functionality and includes features such as the ability to edit component content through a modal popup.

#Features
Drag-and-Drop: Reorder components within a column or move components between columns.
Right-Click to Edit: Right-click on a component to open a modal and edit its name.
Local Storage: The state of the app is saved to local storage, so data persists even after refreshing the page.
Dynamic Background Colors: Each component in the columns is assigned a background color from a predefined set of options.
